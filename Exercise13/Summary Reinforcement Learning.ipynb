    "- **Actions**: The agent can choose from up to 4 actions to move around. In this example\n",
    "- **Environment Dynamics**: GridWorld is deterministic, leading to the same new state given each state and action\n",
    "Rewards: The agent receives +1 reward when it is in the center square (the one that shows R 1.0), and -1 reward in a few states (R -1.0 is shown for these). The state with +1.0 reward is the goal state and resets the agent back to start.\n"
